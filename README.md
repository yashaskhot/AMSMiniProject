## Why our attendance management system ?
Over the time, the majority of educational institutions have
continued to use traditional approach of manual attendance
management which is time consuming and difficult for teachers
to track large number of daily records with loads of paperwork.
‚Ä¢ This manual process uses a lot of paper & ink thus increasing the overall
cost of running an institution.

‚Ä¢ It is a time-consuming process.

‚Ä¢ Huge storage system will be required to keep all the paperwork
organized thus utilizing the institution‚Äôs space.

‚Ä¢ In some cases, the attendance is first recorded on paper and then put
into the software system used by the management leading to more
unnecessary paper wastage.

‚Ä¢ This manual form also makes it tedious to generate any report of the
data that is being stored.

Barriers are: lack of an independent system to automate all this
process.

The system that we have developed is keeping the aim of
‚ÄúSave the resources and time of the institutions and
their professors by automating this process with the
help of a desktop application.‚Äù

## Project scope


Project Scope
Scope of our project lies in:
- This system can be used for a particular institute by setting up
the desktop application in PCs used by Staffs as well as
Admin
- Can be used offline but later on the project can be modified
into a web application as well to operate it
online.
- Teachers‚Äô login, options to add new/ review attendance,
Obtaining reports in statistical/ graphical format.
- A portal for students to have an access to their detailed
attendance report on their own is beyond our scope for
this project.
